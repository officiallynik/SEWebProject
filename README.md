# Kisan Seva

An app that serves the farmer community the purpose of fetching them right value for there crops. Also educate and provide best practises for free to farmers on all kinds of agricultural aspects.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Please Note

We have deployed our frontend application on Vercel platform, It serves all the html, css and js files. And browser takes care of handling these files, hence browser application will be fast.

However, we have deployed our backend application on heroku free tier, which sleeps/deactivates frequently. Hence you may experience lag or long waiting time. Its totally normal and not in our hands. We might deploy this application on fast servers in future. Heroku takes time to wake up and serve, and free tier has less power of serving many users fast. Please bear with it, its totally normal.

### Prerequisites

* NodeJS JavaScript Runtime.
* Node Package Manager (npm).
* Git

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

#### Running the application (locally)
```

open 'http://localhost:3000' in the browser
```
#### Building a local production application
```
npm run build
npm run export
* 'out' directory will have the production build of the application.
```

## Deployment

1. Develop new features or fix bugs locally, with unit tests.
2. Push code to your local repository on github.
3. Issue a pull request to the master branch of this repository.
4. After verification code to be pulled into master branch.
5. After passing all tests successfull application will automatically be deployed. 

## Principles to be followed
1. This application is developed to be optimised for all screen types
2. All components and pages should be responsive, i.e., change according to screen size.
3. Components and pages will have to be optimised for large (desktop), medium (tablets) and small (mobile) screens.
